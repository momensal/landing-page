This is my custom version of the "Landing Page" project from The Odin Project Foundations course.

**Digital Minimalism Bootcamp** â€” a landing page for a program that helps people reset their habits, detox from tech, and build mental discipline.

## What's in it?

This landing page includes:

- A clean, modern layout built with **HTML and CSS** (no frameworks)
- Sections for a bold hero message, feature highlights, testimonials, and a call to action
- Realistic layout and structure based on a provided design reference
